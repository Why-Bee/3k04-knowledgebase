### Our Project
- Vision: get better at model-driven development and principles of software design
- Goal: Design and implement a system that operates a cardiac pacemaker under specified modes
- Scope: Design and implement:
	- Pacemaker software
	- Driver software
	- User Interface
	- Testing and verification
	- Documentation

### Deliverables
- Simulink model for pacemaker modes
- [[DCM]] software
- Documentation
- Live demo

### Model Driven Development
MDD is a paradigm that uses models as the primary artifact in the design process. https://youtu.be/3aoLV5i1feo
Traditionally, we give the computer instructions to do things and we translate the problem and its corresponding solution to computer instructions (code).
But in MDD, we abstract away from the "giving computer instructions" and  instead describe the problem/system in very excruciating detail to the assembler/interpreter. If we are thorough with our description, code is automatically generated.

### Pacemaker SRS
All assignments are based on the Pacemaker System Requirements Specification (SRS) developed by Boston Scientific in 2007.
