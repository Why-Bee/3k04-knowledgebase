___
The heart has 4 chambers
- L/R Atrium
- L/R Ventricle

Left atrium receives oxygen rich blood from the lungs, sends it to L Ventricle, and pumps it to the rest of the body.
Right atrium recieves deoxygenated blood from the body, sends it to R Ventricle, pumps it to the lungs.

### Cardiac Conduction System
- The network that makes your heart beat is called the CCS
- It generates electrical stimuli and also conducts them to the rest of the heart, this allows it to coordinate the movement of the chambers.
#### Cardiac Cycle
The sequence of events that occurs in one heart beat.
1. The SinoAtrial node generates an electric signal that causes atria to contract
2. Signal goes through AtrioVentricular node, and the "Bundle of HIS" (a group of nerve fibers)
	1. AV node: a tissue that delays the cardiac impulse, then sends them to the Purkinje fibers to go to the ventricles
3. The signal spreads through ventricles and causes them to contract
4. Muscle cells then relax and chambers get blood
	1. While the chamber is relaxing, another pulse cannot be generated- this is called a Refractory period
The nodal cells and Purkinje fibers can initiate, respond, and transmit electrical impulses.

#### ECG
- Graphical description of electrical activity in the heart
- The activity can be depicted with surface electrodes, aka leads. These are pads that are placed on the skin surface and can enable recording of electrical currents.
