___
The heart has 4 chambers
- L/R Atrium
- L/R Ventricle

Left atrium receives oxygen rich blood from the lungs, sends it to L Ventricle, and pumps it to the rest of the body.
Right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body, sends it to R Ventricle, pumps it to the lungs.

### Cardiac Conduction System
- The network that makes your heart beat is called the CCS
- It generates electrical stimuli and also conducts them to the rest of the heart, this allows it to coordinate the movement of the chambers.
#### Cardiac Cycle
The sequence of events that occurs in one heart beat.
1. The SinoAtrial node generates an electric signal that causes atria to contract
2. Signal goes through AtrioVentricular node, and the "Bundle of HIS" (a group of nerve fibers)
	1. AV node: a tissue that delays the cardiac impulse, then sends them to the Purkinje fibers to go to the ventricles
3. The signal spreads through ventricles and causes them to contract
4. Muscle cells then relax and chambers get blood
	1. While the chamber is relaxing, another pulse cannot be generated- this is called a Refractory period
The nodal cells and Purkinje fibers can initiate, respond, and transmit electrical impulses.

#### ECG
- Graphical description of electrical activity in the heart
- The activity can be depicted with surface electrodes, aka leads. These are pads that are placed on the skin surface and can enable recording of electrical currents.

- The bottom wave is the resultant of summing various waves. The total ECG wave, aka the cardiac cycle, is represented by PQRST
	- P: contraction of atria
	- PR: delay due to AV node
	- QRS: Ventricular contraction
	- T: Ventricular relaxation
	- TP: Refractory period

#### Link between CCS and Mechanical events of Cardiac cycle

The above diagram shows a plot of pressure and volume in the heart over time
- The ECG shown above correlates with the explanation of PQRST wave
- Phonogram is the sound made by the heart. The 1st and 2nd sounds create the 'lub dub' you can hear with a stethoscope.
### CCS Conduction Disorders
- The CCS signal is not generated properly
- The CCS signal does not travel through heart properly
#### Origins of Conduction Disorders
1. SA Node Failure: The SA node malfunction can cause heart to beat too slowly, too quickly, or erratically. 
2. Abnormal Firing of Chambers: The cells in atria or ventricles may randomly fire and cause feedback/interference with the CCS signal.
3. Conduction Defect: A malfunction in the electrical pathways. Typically delays ventricular contraction. Sometimes there is an unintentional pathway between Atria and Ventricles that causes a short circuit and fires ventricles much faster than expected.
#### Arrhythmia
- A condition where the heart is not beating correctly
- **Bradycardia arrhythmia**: Abnormally slow Resting Heart Rate. Usually, less than 50-60BPM depending on age
- **Tachycardia arrhythmia:** Abnormally fast RHR, above 100BPM

The above combined, lead to the need for a physician to implant a Pacemaker [[Pacemaker Basics]]
